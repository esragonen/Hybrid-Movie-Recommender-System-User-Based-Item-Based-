# Hybrid Movie Recommender System User Based Item Based
This project implements a Hybrid Recommender System by combining user-based collaborative filtering and item-based similarity to generate movie recommendations.
The workflow includes data preparation, filtering low-frequency movies, creating a user–movie interaction matrix, calculating user similarity scores, and producing personalized movie suggestions.
Additionally, the system identifies a user’s most recently highly-rated movie and recommends similar movies using item-based correlation.
The goal is to build a more accurate and robust movie recommendation engine by blending the strengths of both approaches.
